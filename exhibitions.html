                        <h2>Evolution</h2>
                        <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. 
                            Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution 
                            we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved 
                            our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, 
                            including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                        <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important 
                            it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but 
                            for the whole planet.
                            In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global 
                            warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can 
                            all contribute to a brighter future.</p>

                        Oslo Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power 
                        of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that 
                        shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.</p>
