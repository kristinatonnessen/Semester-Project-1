                    <h2>Support</h2>
                    <p>There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very 
                        welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and accessible 
                        to the whole community.</p>
                    <p>You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s 
                        collections. If you have some item or collection that you think others would 
                        enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections Department and they 
                        will be able to assist you.</p>

                    <h2>Volunteer</h2>
                    <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good 
                        order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks 
                        including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to 
                        staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come 
                        together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.</p>
                    <p>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if 
                        you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.</p>

                    <h2>Internships</h2>
                    <p>Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and excitement 
                        of sharing the wonders of nature with people? Well you could be just the right 
                        person to enjoy an internship at the museum.</p>
                    <p>You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people who are 
                        passionate about science and sharing it with the wider community.</p>
