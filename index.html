                <h2>Come join us at the Oslo Science Museum where we’re committed to making
                    science accessible to all.</h2>
                <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding
                    of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to
                    the very building blocks of life itself.
                    The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders
                    of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the
                    exploration of the world around us.</p>
                <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through
                    exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied
                    subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to
                    interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur
                    exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).</p>

                <h5>For kids</h5>
                <p>Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, there’s
                    plenty to see and do.
                    You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time
                    and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested
                    minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.
                    We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00
                    where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.
                    During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your
                    age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out
                    more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.
                </p>

                    in our learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite and inspire
